Description: This package provides the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) in
    a R accessible objects. Signatures are stored in GeneSet class objects form
    the GSEABase package and the entire database is stored in a GeneSetCollection
    object. These data are then hosted on the ExperimentHub. Data used in this 
    package was obtained from the MSigDB of the Broad Institute. Metadata for each
    gene set is stored along with the gene set in the GeneSet class object.
